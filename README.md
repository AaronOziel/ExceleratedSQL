ExceleratedSQL
==============

This is a program that will move Excel data into a SQL Database.

Write a program that allows the user to select which .xls or .xlsx file to import, grab the data from the spreadsheet, and send the data to a stored procedure on a SQL Server. You are allowed to use whatever tools/methods you can find on the internet to assist in the project. Use whatever language/tool set you are comfortable with but you must tell me why a tool was used."
